## Submitting new components

You can submit a new component directly in the design system.

When submitting a component, you have to add:

- basic information about the component
- an image of the component
- your personal details

This gives the design system team a basic understanding of the component and how to use it. As well as the means to contact you if required.

You'll also have the opportunity to add further information on the component if you have it.

### All new components are reviewed by the design team

The MoJ Design System team review new components before they go live. This can take up to 5 working days.

The review involves the team checking the information and image you provided. And ensuring there is enough information to be useful to all users of the design system.

### What happens after the review?

If there are no issues and the team does not need to contact you, the component will be added to the design system. It will include a 'community' tag. This means it is still in the development phase and not yet a complete component.

The team will contact you by email when the component goes live.
