<p class="govuk-!-margin-bottom-6">This content style guide applies to services and guidance at MoJ. It should be used alongside the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/style-guide/a-to-z-of-gov-uk-style">GOV.UK content style guide</a>.</p>

### acronyms and initialisms
Acronyms and initialisms in services do not need to be spelt out if they are well understood by your audience. This also helps if it's difficult to spell them out, such as in a table.

If users are familiar with the acronym but you would still like to help them, you can spell it out afterwards, for example 'PDU (probation delivery unit)'.

For guidance or long-form content, spell them out on first mention (following the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/style-guide/a-to-z-of-gov-uk-style#a">GOV.UK guidance on abbreviations and acronyms</a>).

### alerts (DPS only)
Only use 'alerts' when talking about alerts created in NOMIS or DPS.
Alerts can be 'active' or 'inactive'. You may find language in DPS that refers to 'adding', 'opening' and 'closing' alerts. We hope to make this language more consistent as we stop using NOMIS.

### aliases
Always 'aliases' when talking about other names a person has on their record. This term is commonly used and understood in prisons. Using a different term may confuse users.

### Assessment, Care in Custody and Teamwork (ACCT)
Use ACCT. This is more well known than the full version.

### breadcrumbs
Do not show the current page in the list of breadcrumbs.

In DPS, the first breadcrumb should always be 'Digital Prison Services'.

        <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">capitalisation</h3>
        <p class="govuk-body">For general terms, follow the guidance in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/style-guide/a-to-z-of-gov-uk-style">GOV.UK style guide</a>.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">We do not have a standard approach to capitalising acronyms or initialisms when they are written out in full.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">You may decide to capitalise abbreviations when:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>you’re referring to the proper name for something</li>
            <li>it would help users understand what you’re referring to</li>
            <li>the full version of the abbreviation is long</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="govuk-body">Please share your decisions on capitalising abbreviations. We’ll add these as entries to the style guide to ensure consistency across DPS tools.</p>
        <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Category (such as Category A prison)</h3>
        <p class="govuk-body">Always capitalise and write out in full. For example, 'Category A'.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">Do not use 'Cat'.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">Use 'Category A – high' for high-profile prisoners.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">Use 'Category A – provisional' for provisional Category A prisoners.</p>
        <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">caseload (changing caseload)</h3>
        <p class="govuk-body">If your service lets users change their 'caseload', always use 'change location' instead. 'Caseload' is a legacy term from NOMIS that would need explaining to users.</p>
        <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">case note</h3>
        <p class="govuk-body">This is 2 separate words. Not casenote.</p>
        <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">cell</h3>
        <p class="govuk-body">Cell or cells should be used to refer to the rooms that people in prison live in. There are some instances in the open, female and youth estate where alternatives such as 'dormitory' or 'room' may be more appropriate. But for services rolled out across the entire prison estate, cell is likely to be the most widely understood term. There is also research to suggest prisoners do not see 'cell' as a stigmatising term, but an accurate description of accommodation in prisons across England and Wales.</p>
        <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Cell Sharing Risk Assessment (CSRA)</h3>
        <p class="govuk-body">Use CSRA. This is more well known than the full version.</p>
        <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Challenge, Support and Intervention Plan (CSIP)</h3>
        <p class="govuk-body">Use CSIP. This is more well known than the full version.</p>
        <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">clock</h3>
        <p class="govuk-body">See <a href="#times">times</a> for guidance on using the 12 or 24-hour clock.</p>
        <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">closed prison, closed conditions</h3>
        <p class="govuk-body">Lower case.</p>
        <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">community probation practitioner</h3>
        <p class="govuk-body">This is a probation practitioner who works in the community and not in prisons.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">It's better than 'community offender manager (COM)', although someone may have this job title. Refers to a probation officer, probation support officer or senior probation officer.</p>
        <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">contractions</h3>
        <p class="govuk-body">Follow the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/style-guide/a-to-z-of-gov-uk-style">GOV.UK style guide</a> and avoid using negative contractions like can’t and don’t.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">Avoid contractions with a noun and verb such as ‘the computer’s fast’. This may be misunderstood as showing possession. Use ‘the computer is fast’ instead.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">You can use positive contractions like we’ll and you’ll.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">We’d like to test positive contractions with users to find out if they’re more difficult to understand.</p>
        <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">CRN (case reference number)</h3>
        <p class="govuk-body">The reference assigned to a person on probation in NDelius. Not NDelius number, case number or CRN number. The initialism may be sufficient without being spelt out. The format is 2 characters, 4 numbers and then 2 characters for example ‘RG5108AC’.</p>
{% endaccordionSection %}

{% accordionSection "D" %}
        <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">dates</h3>
        <p class="govuk-body">If users can choose a date range, use 'earliest' and 'latest' in your labels. For example:</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">'Date from (earliest)'</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">'Date to (latest)'</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">This is being used on the DPS prisoner profile alerts and case notes pages in response to user feedback.</p>
        <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">DPS, Digital Prison Services</h3>
        <p class="govuk-body">Not 'the Digital Prison Service'.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">DPS may be referred to as 'New NOMIS' in prisons, but we should always use 'DPS' or 'Digital Prison Services'.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">The acronym 'DPS' is well understood and can be used without the full name.</p>
