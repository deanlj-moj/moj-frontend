title: Supporting Internet Explorer 8
---

As of version 2.0.0, MoJ Frontend no longer provides support for Internet Explorer 8, in line with changes to the GOV.UK Design System and after Microsoft [stopped supporting all versions of Internet Explorer in 2022](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/internet-explorer-help-23360e49-9cd3-4dda-ba52-705336cc0de2). You should no longer use Internet Explorer.

If your service still requires support for Internet Explorer 8, you have two options:

You can **provide your own support for Internet Explorer 8**. You are welcome to use an additional CSS file that will patch features that are not supported in older browsers. However, you must do this at your own risk.

You can **continue to use an unmaintained v1 version of MoJ Frontend**. This is not recommended as you will miss important updates, but may be necessary to support legacy tech as it approaches its end of life.
