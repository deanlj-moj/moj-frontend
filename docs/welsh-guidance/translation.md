<h2 class="govuk-heading-l" id="define">Defining a process for translation and content maintenance</h2>

To define a translation process that works for you, it may help to think about:

**Use cases** - map out of all the use cases. For example, adding new features and content to the service, making changes to existing content, etc.

**Responsibilities** - think about who will be responsible for looking after the Welsh side of things. This could include triaging, managing translations, usability testing, quality assurance. People might be involved and responsible for different stages.

**Workflows** - consider at what points you’ll be able to translate content, and how it fits in with your sign-off process and more general ways of working.

**Tools and tech** - how can you make the most of the tools and tech you already use to support these workflows? For example, raising tickets and notifying team members.

**Your translation team** - find out how they like to work, and involve them as early as possible. Think about all the ways you’ll need their support - for example, would it help if they reviewed the translations once uploaded to the product or service?

<h2 class="govuk-heading-l" id="prepare">Preparing the English content document for translation</h2>

Here are some things you might need to think about:

**Dynamic content** - put personalisation or dynamic content in a different colour. Explain that this is conditional content and they do not need to translate it at the start of the document.

**Duplication** - if there’s a lot of duplication, you could ask the WLU to translate just once, but you’ll need a way of keeping track of any duplicated content.

**Context** - add screenshots to your document for context. You can also add a row header explaining the part of the journey if it’s important.

**Batching content** - consider if you can send your content in journeys or batches. This might make it easier to manage, and may also mean you get batches back quicker from the WLU.

**Clear columns** - make sure that the column for translation only includes things you want translated.

**Overwriting English text** - add a separate column for them to add the translations so they do not overwrite the English text. This will make it easier for non-Welsh speakers to be able to see the English and Welsh text side-by-side.

**Links and buttons** - underline links and highlight buttons in the English content so that the WLU know which words to underline or highlight when they write the Welsh content.

**Acronyms and abbreviations** - spell these out in full to explain them as the WLU may not know what these mean. We also send our style guide.

**Translating comms** - consider if you need comms to be translated as well, as these may not be in the JSON files your devs may give you. They will most likely be stored in Gov Notify, so you’ll have to add these to your translation document separately.

**Translation keys** - you could add a column for ‘translation keys’ and tell the translator not to translate this column. This might be helpful for you and your developers when you get the translations back and need to add them to Weblate.

<h2 class="govuk-heading-l" id="weblate">Using Weblate</h2>

The modernising lasting power of attorney team was the first team at the Ministry of Justice to pilot a translation management tool called Weblate.

They created a ‘translator’ role so that the Welsh Language Unit would be able to make changes to existing Welsh content when there are changes to the English.

This role has a peer review process where a translator can make a suggestion, and another person can upvote or downvote it. Suggestions show under ‘strings with suggestions’.

<h2 class="govuk-heading-l" id="testing">Welsh content testing</h2>

When we test Welsh content with Welsh language users, we might want to focus on the content itself, rather than the functionality of the service.

Here are some of the things we can test for:

**Readability and comprehension** - can users understand the content? Are there unfamiliar words or ones that do not make sense? At what points do they toggle into English and why?

**Consistency** - is the language consistent across the service? And does it seem consistent with the English when they toggle?

**Tone** - how do users describe the tone? A common complaint is that Welsh is often written too formally, which can make it difficult to understand.

**Expectations** - what language do you expect to see when you toggle or use a link? Which language would they expect their LPA to be in? And which language would they expect to use their LPA in?

<h2 class="govuk-heading-l" id="recruiting">Recruiting Welsh language users</h2>

We have 2 ways of recruiting test participants:

1. Criteria, a research recruitment agency (we pay participants through them)
2. Finding volunteers ourselves (we cannot pay participants)

When recruiting volunteers, it’s best practice to provide the sign-up form in both Welsh and English.

[How to create a multi-language form in the Google Forms](https://www.addxt.com/how-to/how-to-create-multi-language-google-forms) (addtx.com)

[How to send a form in multiple languages with Microsoft Forms](https://support.microsoft.com/en-au/office/send-a-form-in-multiple-languages-e948a2ea-31c8-432f-91bf-67790e226706#:~:text=Click%20More%20form%20settings,%2C%20and%20then%20select%20Multilingual.) (Microsoft)

<h2 class="govuk-heading-l" id="comms">Communications for recruitment</h2>

Always provide any communications for recruitment in both Welsh and English. This includes emails, survey forms and consent forms.

When we message potential volunteers, they may not feel confident about their Welsh speaking ability and decline. Try to make it clear that it’s to test the content, not their Welsh.

We could say something like this to reassure them:

<table class="govuk-table">
  <thead class="govuk-table__head">
    <tr class="govuk-table__row">
      <th scope="col" class="govuk-table__header">English</th>
      <th scope="col" class="govuk-table__header">Cymraeg</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody class="govuk-table__body">
  <tr class="govuk-table__row">
    <tr class="govuk-table__row">
      <td class="govuk-table__cell">We want to make sure that our online service is easy to use in Welsh. To do this, we're looking for volunteers to try the service and give us some feedback on the wording.<br><br>

      We want to hear from as many Welsh speakers as we can from all across Wales, no matter if they're a fluent Welsh speaker or a learner. (Even if your Welsh is a bit rusty, we're testing the wording on the website, not your Welsh!)

      The sessions will be informal with 2 friendly people over a video call, and all we'll ask is for you read to the wording on the website to see if it makes sense and if it's written in everyday language.

      Welsh is sometimes overlooked in government services, and we're doing this so we can make the service the best it can be.

      If you can give us some time, please complete this form. And we'd really appreciate if you could forward it on to any Welsh speakers you know.

<h2 class="govuk-heading-l" id="bilingual">Running a bilingual content testing session</h2>

The Welsh Language Unit can provide a translator for user research and usability testing sessions.

They charge £55 per hour (cost on February 2024), and need at least 2 to 3 weeks of notice.

You’ll need to discuss what support you need, for example:

- note-taking in Welsh
- live interpreting from Welsh into English during the session
- transcribing recordings from Welsh to English

Remember that Dovetail does not support Welsh.
