<h2 class="govuk-heading-l" id="commitments">Understanding your commitments</h2>

Your organisation or department might have a commitment to the Welsh language. This is sometimes called a ‘Welsh language scheme’.

[Here’s an example of the Office of the Public Guardian’s scheme](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/office-of-the-public-guardian/about/welsh-language-scheme#:~:text=This%20scheme%20sets%20out%20how,conducting%20public%20business%20in%20Wales.).

Getting to know these commitments before you start can help you:

- work out exactly what you must offer in Welsh - for example, is it an end-to-end service, or only certain information?
- know who else is responsible for Welsh so that you can lean on them when you need to - for example, you might have a Welsh language coordinator.
- remind people of what you should be doing if Welsh is treated as an afterthought.

<h2 class="govuk-heading-l" id="responsibility">Welsh is everyone’s responsibility</h2>

Too often, Welsh ends up on the task list of just one person. This might be the only Welsh speaker on a team, or a content designer responsible for English content.

Yet Welsh touches on most people’s roles, and teams should take a collective responsibility for it. This way, it does not become the “burden” of just one person. And if that person is off or leaves, there won’t be a scramble to try and work out what to do about Welsh.

You could try a team workshop where you ask everyone to write down:

- in what ways the Welsh language relates to their roles,
- why it’s important that you get it right,
- any challenges or blockers.

While this activity isn’t going to win hearts and change minds instantly, it’s a good reminder that Welsh should be a collective effort.

<h2 class="govuk-heading-l" id="preferences">Users’ language preferences</h2>

If you need to communicate with your users through email, letters or SMS, it helps to capture their preferences so you can contact them in their preferred language.

Some participants told the modernising lasting power of attorney team during research that they’d like the option to choose both English and Welsh.

The Welsh Language Unit also suggested that it’s good practice to separate different communication methods and allow users to choose their preferred language for each.

Using a user’s postcode to guess their language is not a good idea because:

- not all people living in Wales speak Welsh,
- not all Welsh speakers live in Wales.

You’ll need to think about [how you get your communications translated](/welsh-guidance/translation), and what happens if users respond in Welsh.

<h2 class="govuk-heading-l" id="toggle">Toggling between Welsh and English</h2>

Research from the modernising lasting power of attorney (MLPA) team found that being able to toggle back and forth between languages helped participants to check:

- their understanding of the information
- unfamiliar words or terms
- that the Welsh translation was correct

In the research, some participants said they were used to finding the ‘Cymraeg/English’ toggle feature in the top right corner of the screen.

One thing to think about is whether you’re able to save information a user enters in a free text box before they switch languages.

For example, on the Make an LPA digital service, you lose information if you toggle into the other language before saving your progress.

<h2 class="govuk-heading-l" id="tools">Address look-up and calendar tools</h2>

If someone is using the Welsh service, they might expect to enter details in Welsh.

Can you display data like addresses and dates in Welsh?

<h2 class="govuk-heading-l" id="free-text">Free text boxes</h2>

It’s important to think about what happens when users enter into free text boxes in Welsh. Where is this information stored, and who accesses it?

If they enter the information in Welsh, do you either:

- have someone who can understand it (and respond, if needed)?
- have someone who can translate it for you?

<h2 class="govuk-heading-l" id="answers">Yes / No answers</h2>

Hard-coding ‘yes’ and ‘no’ as answers to questions works in English, but does not work in Welsh.

This is because how you answer depends on the question.

[You can see examples here](https://www.jackpulmanslater.com/yes-no).

<h2 class="govuk-heading-l" id="linking">Linking to English products and services</h2>

If you’re linking to other products and services that are not available in Welsh, it’s good practice to set expectations and let users know.

You can do this in different ways, for example:

See guidance from X organisation. This link opens in English.

<h2 class="govuk-heading-l" id="translating">Designing bilingually or translating</h2>

Some organisations have tried a technique called trio writing to design content in Welsh and English at the same time.
