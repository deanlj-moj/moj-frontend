<span class="govuk-caption-xl">The MoJ Design System helps people quickly design, build and launch scalable services that are user-led and consistent with one another.</span>

## Centralised updates

Updates are published when building block is changed in, or added to, the MoJ Design System. Updating to the latest version of the design system applies these changes to your prototype or service.

Figma prototypes receive updates from 3 Figma Kits which are kept up to date with the MoJ and GOV.UK Design Systems, as long as instances of components are not detached. [Read about setting up Figma prototypes](/prototyping/setting-up-figma-prototypes/).

Coded prototypes and live services receive updates from MoJ frontend. [Read about setting up coded prototypes](/prototyping/setting-up-coded-prototypes/).

## Consistency

Making sure MoJ services are consistent with one another makes them easier to use.

The MoJ Design System has building blocks, standards and principles that help create consistency:

- [Components](/components/) and [patterns](/patterns/) provide clear visual style, interaction standards and code semantics.
- The [content style guide](/content-standards/style-guide) ensures that phrases and terms are the same across different services.
- [Ethical principles](/ethics/principles/) ensure MoJ services are each adhering to the same ethical standards.

## Efficiency

Using building blocks from the MoJ Design System reduces the amount of time teams spend solving problems, because components and patterns are built on the learnings of others who have already solved the problem.

Using the design system can lead to faster design ideation, prototyping, collaboration and development. It can also reduce time spent:
- accessibility testing
- user testing
- explaining design and development choices in service assessments
- fixing design and technical debt after a service has been launched

## Multidisciplinary input

Each building block in the MoJ Design System is worked on by a central, multidisciplinary team.

Before any building block is marked as 'Reviewed' it will have the input of a content designer, interaction designer, front-end developer, accessibility specialist, design system lead and delivery manager. [Read about how building blocks move between tiers (link text TBC)](#).

## Contributing

The MoJ Design System is built on input from the community of users in the MoJ. There are multiple ways of helping the design system grow:

1. Taking part in discovery research led by the MoJ Design System team.
2. Submitting new components and patterns.
3. Adding research insight or suggesting changes on the Github discussions for each building block.
4. Adding comments to the [#moj-design-system-support Slack channel (MoJ staff only)](https://moj.enterprise.slack.com/archives/CH5RUSB27).
