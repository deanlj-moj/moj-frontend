If you have research findings, design solutions or code that teams could reuse:

## 1. Discuss with the community
       
Share your solution with the MOJ design community for input and feedback. 

Prepare for the discussion by:

- writing a description of your product and the user needs related to the component
- gathering similar examples from others in MOJ

<details class="govuk-details" data-module="govuk-details">
 
  <summary class="govuk-details__summary">
    <span class="govuk-details__summary-text">
      Help with where to discuss
    </span>
  </summary>

<div class="govuk-details__text">
<p class="govuk-body">You can share in a channel on Slack:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li><a href="#">#user-centred-design</a></li>
  <li><a href="#">#moj-crit</a></li>
</ul>
<p class="govuk-body">or in a community meet up:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>MOJ user centred design crit</li>
  <li>Professional systems action group</li>
</ul>
  </div>

</details>

## 2. Decide on a solution

Once the community reviews your solution and similar examples from others, vote on which option to take forward.

The solution can be a work in progress, it doesn't need to include code or all the variations that may be needed.


## 3. Document in GitHub

Check [exists discussions](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/moj-frontend/discussions) and add your solution as a comment.

If a similar discussion doesn't exist, you can start a [new discussion](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/moj-frontend/discussions/new) to add your information.

The MOJ Enablers group will review the solution and add it to the MOJ Pattern Library.
